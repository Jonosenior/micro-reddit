# Micro Reddit

This is a small tutorial project to create a limited functionality Reddit clone.

My learning goal was to practice creating models using Active Record. The app uses Rails to build the data structures necessary to support creating posts and commenting.

It's from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record).

## Skills Practiced

* Using Active Record to represent data objects.
* Running database migrations.
* Creating validations with the built-in Active Record helpers.
* Declaring associations between my models.
